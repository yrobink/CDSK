# CDSK (Chaotic Dynamical System Kit)

## Clone

Python and R version are given in git submodules, so use:

~~~bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/yrobink/CDSK
~~~

## Features
- python3 and R version
- Generation of classic chaotic attractors
- Generation of Mandelbrot and Julia set
- Estimation of Local Dimension and persistence

## Note
For python, CDSK requires the [SDFC](https://github.com/yrobink/SDFC) package,
and for R, the [pmetric](https://github.com/yrobink/pmetric) package.

## Example
